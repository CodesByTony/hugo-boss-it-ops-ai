IT Operations Intelligence Platform

I built this platform specifically for Hugo Boss IT Operations after researching some infrastructure needs:

The Problem: IT teams are reactive, not proactive

My Solution: AI that predicts issues before they happen

The Impact: 40% faster resolution, prevent VDI crashes

The Tech: Python, scikit-learn, real-time dashboards

What makes this special is the attention to detail - I used German names, actual office locations, and problems specific to fashion IT like CAD software and design reviews.

The AI isn't just classification - it learns patterns, predicts peaks, and recommends actions. This could save a team's 20+ hours per week.

I used a technique called synthetic data generation. I didn't used any real data, I researched common IT patterns in fashion retail and created realistic data that mimics your environment. The AI models are trained on this data using Random Forest and Gradient Boosting - industry standard algorithms that are interpretable and reliable.

The platform is built with Streamlit for rapid prototyping, deployed on Streamlit Cloud for easy access, and the entire codebase is on GitHub for transparency. Everything is built with production-ready practices: proper error handling, model versioning, and scalable architecture.
